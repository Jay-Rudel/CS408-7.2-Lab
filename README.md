# CS408 - M7.2 Lab
    This project is showing how and what you can do for different
    display options. As well as different layout options in general. 
    
    We are given a file and then we are tasked with adding layout to
    the project. We do were also not tasked with changing the overall 
    index design just strictly the CSS.

## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. 
    This allows you to see the page, and interact with the page without 
    having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called "index.html"

## Verification
   As we only really changed the CSS I only went and verified that file. 
   The verification said that it was good. I only slightly did some modifications
   to index to make it work with what I personally have thing set up as. Which means
   fixing the link for the style sheet and then where the images themselves are located.

## Testing
    For this particular project there was no 
    extra tests and no tests that need to be ran.

## References
    I went and took a look back at the notes that we have been given for 
    display. I wanted to see the different options and How to get them to work.
